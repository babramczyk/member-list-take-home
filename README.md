# If I had more time

- Possibly use Next.js, Remix, or whatever, i.e. for a quicker first paint, possibly server-side rendering the member list, etc.
  - I just didn't want to muck around in Next docs, deal with hydration issues, etc. -- instead, wanted to focus on the main problem. So I justed used CRA
- All `TODO`s remaining in source ðŸ˜„
- Use a `<table>` for better HTML semantics, and possibly some a11y benefits
  - Opted to not use one, since I know they can be tricky WRT styling, flexbox, etc. In a production app where we had the time, we could maybe invest the time to make a `<table>` work, but I didn't want to eff with that for now

# To-do

- Styling
  - Review colors
