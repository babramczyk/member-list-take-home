# If I had more time

- Possibly use Next.js, Remix, or whatever, i.e. for a quicker first paint, possibly server-side rendering the member list, etc.
  - I just didn't want to muck around in Next docs, deal with hydration issues, etc. -- instead, wanted to focus on the main problem. So I justed used CRA
- All `TODO`s remaining in source ðŸ˜„
